# aethflow
A very basic attempt at making a more interactive website UI by utilizing three.js and GSAP. <br />

Cubes are positioned randomly on page-load around the 3D scene space. Mouse-over moves them to other random positions in an animated fashion (must find a way to make the animations smoother). 2 dedicated cubes for hyperlinking, they don't move but instead shake on mouseover. <br />
